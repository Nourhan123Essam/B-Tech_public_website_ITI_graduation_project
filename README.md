# E-Commerce Frontend (Angular)

## Overview
This repository contains the frontend for an E-Commerce platform built with **Angular**. The frontend integrates with an **ASP.NET Web API** backend to provide users with a seamless experience for managing orders, viewing cart items, making payments, and more.

## Features
### Cart and Payment Flow
- **Cart Component**:
   - Displays items in the cart and allows users to update quantities or delete items.
   - If the user is not logged in, a popup is shown with options to either log in or continue exploring.
   - If the cart is empty, users are informed and can navigate back to the home page.
   
- **Payment Component**:
   - Displays a summary of the items in the cart, including their images, quantities, and prices.
   - Allows users to provide delivery information and choose a payment method.
   - **Cash on Delivery**: Allows users to place an order without online payment.
   - **PayPal**: Integrates with the backend to handle PayPal payments.

- **PayPal Buttons**:
   - Displays PayPal payment buttons and handles the integration for finalizing payments.

- **City Sidebar Component**:
   - A dynamic sidebar for selecting a city during the delivery info phase.

- **My Orders Component**:
   - Allows users to view their past orders, with options to cancel orders (if not shipped yet) and view order details.

### Components
- **Cart Component** (`cart.component.ts`)
- **Payment Component** (`payment.component.ts`)

- **Order Items Component** (`my-orders-items.component.ts`)

### Routing
The app includes routing to manage navigation between pages such as the cart, payment page, and order history.
